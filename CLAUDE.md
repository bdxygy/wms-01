# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Warehouse Management System (WMS)** - A complete inventory management system for tracking goods across multiple stores with role-based access control, featuring web and mobile applications.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Hono, Node.js, Zod, Drizzle, SQLite Turso âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Frontend Web**: React, Shadcn, Zod, React Query, Tailwindcss, Rsbuild ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**
- **Mobile**: Flutter (cross-platform mobile development) âœ… **PHASE 15 COMPLETE - TRANSACTION CREATION SYSTEM READY**

### Architecture

- **Service layer** for business logic
- **Soft delete** for audit trail
- **Owner-scoped data access** for non-owner roles
- **Hono best practice pattern** - no controller layer, routes use service layer directly

### Role Hierarchy & Permissions

1. **OWNER**: Full system access, can manage multiple stores and all user roles
2. **ADMIN**: Store-scoped CRU access (no delete), can manage STAFF users only
3. **STAFF**: Read-only + product checking across owner's stores
4. **CASHIER**: SALE transactions only, read access to owner's stores

## ðŸš€ **BACKEND: PRODUCTION READY (51 TypeScript files)**

**40+ API endpoints** fully implemented with JWT authentication, RBAC, IMEI tracking, barcode generation, photo proof, validation, error handling, pagination, filtering, and comprehensive testing.

### Key API Endpoints
```
Authentication: POST /api/v1/auth/{dev/register,register,login,refresh,logout}
Users: CRUD /api/v1/users (with pagination)
Stores: CRUD /api/v1/stores (OWNER only)
Categories: CRUD /api/v1/categories (OWNER/ADMIN)
Products: CRUD /api/v1/products + /api/v1/products/barcode/:barcode + /api/v1/products/imeis/:imei
Transactions: CRUD /api/v1/transactions (SALE/TRANSFER types)
IMEI Management: /api/v1/products/:id/imeis, /api/v1/imeis/:id
```

## ðŸ“± **MOBILE: PHASE 15 COMPLETE - TRANSACTION CREATION & ITEM MANAGEMENT (85+ Dart files)**

## ðŸ”§ **Development Guidelines**

### Business Rules
- Products must have unique barcodes within owner scope
- SALE transactions require at least one product item and photo proof
- All data is owner-scoped (non-OWNER roles see data from same owner only)
- Soft delete for audit trail

### Code Standards
- **DRY & KISS**: Avoid duplication, keep solutions simple
- **Type Safety**: Use Zod schemas, typed models throughout
- **Security**: Never expose secrets/keys, validate all inputs
- **Testing**: Test at controller layer via HTTP endpoints
- **ID Generation**: `randomUUID()` for DB primary keys, `nanoid()` for barcodes only

### ðŸš« **CRITICAL DATABASE MODEL PROTECTION** ðŸš«
**NEVER MODIFY** these files without explicit user request:
- `src/models/users.ts`, `src/models/stores.ts`, `src/models/categories.ts`
- `src/models/products.ts`, `src/models/transactions.ts`, `src/models/product_checks.ts`, `src/models/product_imeis.ts`

### API Response Standards
- **ALWAYS use `ResponseUtils`** from `src/utils/responses.ts`
- **ALWAYS use Zod schemas** for validation
- **Required format**: `BaseResponse<T>` or `PaginatedResponse<T>`

## ðŸ“Š **Next Steps**

2. âœ… **Mobile Phase 11**: Barcode Scanner Integration *(COMPLETED - Multiple format support, scanner overlay, product search)*
3. âœ… **Mobile Phase 12**: IMEI Scanner & Product Search *(COMPLETED - Industry-standard IMEI system with product management)*
4. **Mobile Phase 13**: Transaction Management & Sales (4-5 days) *(Next Priority)*
5. **Mobile Phase 14**: Product CRUD Forms (3-4 days)
6. **Mobile Phase 15**: Settings & User Profile (2-3 days)
7. **Web Frontend Development**: Build React UI using the complete API contract (optional)

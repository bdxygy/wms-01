# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Warehouse Management System (WMS)** - A complete inventory management system for tracking goods across multiple stores with role-based access control, featuring web and mobile applications.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Hono, Node.js, Zod, Drizzle, SQLite Turso âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control âœ… **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Frontend Web**: React, Shadcn, Zod, React Query, Tailwindcss, Rsbuild ðŸ“‹ **PLANNED**
- **Mobile**: Flutter (cross-platform mobile development) âœ… **PHASE 12 COMPLETE - IMEI SCANNER SYSTEM READY**

### Architecture

- **Service layer** for business logic
- **Soft delete** for audit trail
- **Owner-scoped data access** for non-owner roles
- **Hono best practice pattern** - no controller layer, routes use service layer directly

### Role Hierarchy & Permissions

1. **OWNER**: Full system access, can manage multiple stores and all user roles
2. **ADMIN**: Store-scoped CRU access (no delete), can manage STAFF users only
3. **STAFF**: Read-only + product checking across owner's stores
4. **CASHIER**: SALE transactions only, read access to owner's stores

## ðŸš€ **BACKEND: PRODUCTION READY (51 TypeScript files)**

**40+ API endpoints** fully implemented with JWT authentication, RBAC, IMEI tracking, barcode generation, photo proof, validation, error handling, pagination, filtering, and comprehensive testing.

### Key API Endpoints
```
Authentication: POST /api/v1/auth/{dev/register,register,login,refresh,logout}
Users: CRUD /api/v1/users (with pagination)
Stores: CRUD /api/v1/stores (OWNER only)
Categories: CRUD /api/v1/categories (OWNER/ADMIN)
Products: CRUD /api/v1/products + /api/v1/products/barcode/:barcode + /api/v1/products/imeis/:imei
Transactions: CRUD /api/v1/transactions (SALE/TRANSFER types)
IMEI Management: /api/v1/products/:id/imeis, /api/v1/imeis/:id
```

## ðŸ“± **MOBILE: PHASE 12 COMPLETE - IMEI SCANNER & PRODUCT SEARCH (75+ Dart files)**

**Current Status**: 60% Complete (12/20 phases) | **Next**: Phase 13 - Transaction Management & Sales

### Latest Completion: Phase 12 - IMEI Scanner & Product Search âœ…

- âœ… **Phase 7**: Role-Based Dashboard Screens (Owner/Admin/Staff/Cashier with tailored UI)
- âœ… **Phase 8**: *(Skipped to Phase 10)*
- âœ… **Phase 9**: *(Skipped to Phase 10)*
- âœ… **Phase 10**: Camera Service & Photo Capture (Production-ready photo capture system)
- âœ… **Phase 11**: Barcode Scanner Integration (Multiple format support, scanner overlay, product search)
- âœ… **Phase 12**: IMEI Scanner & Product Search (Industry-standard IMEI system with product management)

### Key Features Implemented
- **Authentication Flow**: JWT with role-based navigation, store selection for non-owners
- **Navigation System**: GoRouter with authentication guards, declarative routing with global redirect logic
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Owner (8 sections), Admin (6 sections), Staff (4 sections), Cashier (4 sections) with permission-aware UI
- **Camera System**: Professional photo capture with compression, multi-photo support, storage management, photo preview/zoom
- **Barcode Scanner System**: Multiple format support (EAN, UPC, Code128, QR), scanner overlay, product search integration
- **IMEI Scanner System**: Industry-standard IMEI validation (Luhn algorithm), product search, management interface
- **UI Components**: Material Design 3, comprehensive theme system, responsive design, loading states
- **Services**: CameraService, ScannerService, ImeiScannerService, AuthService, StoreContextProvider with persistence
- **Internationalization**: 220+ translation keys covering auth, navigation, camera, scanner functionality
- **15+ Screens**: Splash, Login, Store Selection, Dashboard, Camera, Photo Viewer, Barcode Scanner, IMEI Scanner, IMEI Management, Settings, Error screens

### Recent Developments âœ…

**Phase 11 & 12 Implementation:**
- **BarcodeScannerScreen**: Professional scanner with multiple format support (EAN, UPC, Code128, QR)
- **ScannerService**: Complete barcode scanning service with validation and product search integration
- **ImeiScannerScreen**: Industry-standard IMEI scanner with Luhn algorithm validation
- **ImeiUtils**: Comprehensive IMEI validation, formatting, TAC/serial extraction utilities
- **ProductImeiManagementScreen**: Complete IMEI management interface for products
- **ImeiProductSearchWidget**: Transaction workflow integration components

**Code Quality**: Reduced flutter analyze issues from 172 â†’ 158 by resolving IMEI implementation issues and type conflicts.

## ðŸ”§ **Development Guidelines**

### Business Rules
- Products must have unique barcodes within owner scope
- SALE transactions require at least one product item and photo proof
- All data is owner-scoped (non-OWNER roles see data from same owner only)
- Soft delete for audit trail

### Code Standards
- **DRY & KISS**: Avoid duplication, keep solutions simple
- **Type Safety**: Use Zod schemas, typed models throughout
- **Security**: Never expose secrets/keys, validate all inputs
- **Testing**: Test at controller layer via HTTP endpoints
- **ID Generation**: `randomUUID()` for DB primary keys, `nanoid()` for barcodes only

### ðŸš« **CRITICAL DATABASE MODEL PROTECTION** ðŸš«
**NEVER MODIFY** these files without explicit user request:
- `src/models/users.ts`, `src/models/stores.ts`, `src/models/categories.ts`
- `src/models/products.ts`, `src/models/transactions.ts`, `src/models/product_checks.ts`, `src/models/product_imeis.ts`

### API Response Standards
- **ALWAYS use `ResponseUtils`** from `src/utils/responses.ts`
- **ALWAYS use Zod schemas** for validation
- **Required format**: `BaseResponse<T>` or `PaginatedResponse<T>`

## ðŸ“Š **Next Steps**

5. **Mobile Phase 14**: Product CRUD Forms (3-4 days)
6. **Mobile Phase 15**: Settings & User Profile (2-3 days)
7. **Web Frontend Development**: Build React UI using the complete API contract (optional)

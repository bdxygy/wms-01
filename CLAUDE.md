This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Warehouse Management System (WMS)** - A complete inventory management system for tracking goods across multiple stores with role-based access control, featuring web and mobile applications.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Hono, Node.js, Zod, Drizzle, SQLite Turso ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Frontend Web**: React, Shadcn, Zod, React Query, Tailwindcss, Rsbuild 📋 **PLANNED**
- **Mobile**: Flutter (cross-platform mobile development) ✅ **PHASE 15+ COMPLETE - FULL BUSINESS WORKFLOWS READY**

### Architecture

- **Service layer** for business logic
- **Soft delete** for audit trail
- **Owner-scoped data access** for non-owner roles
- **Hono best practice pattern** - no controller layer, routes use service layer directly

### Role Hierarchy & Permissions

1. **OWNER**: Full system access, can manage multiple stores and all user roles
2. **ADMIN**: Store-scoped CRU access (no delete), can manage STAFF users only
3. **STAFF**: Read-only + product checking across owner's stores
4. **CASHIER**: SALE transactions only, read access to owner's stores

## 🚀 **BACKEND: PRODUCTION READY (51 TypeScript files)**

**40+ API endpoints** fully implemented with JWT authentication, RBAC, IMEI tracking, barcode generation, photo proof, validation, error handling, pagination, filtering, and comprehensive testing.

### Key API Endpoints
```
Authentication: POST /api/v1/auth/{dev/register,register,login,refresh,logout}
Users: CRUD /api/v1/users (with pagination)
Stores: CRUD /api/v1/stores (OWNER only)
Categories: CRUD /api/v1/categories (OWNER/ADMIN)
Products: CRUD /api/v1/products + /api/v1/products/barcode/:barcode + /api/v1/products/imeis/:imei
Transactions: CRUD /api/v1/transactions (SALE/TRANSFER types)
IMEI Management: /api/v1/products/:id/imeis, /api/v1/imeis/:id
```

## 🔧 **Development Guidelines**

### Business Rules
- Products must have unique barcodes within owner scope
- SALE transactions require at least one product item and photo proof
- All data is owner-scoped (non-OWNER roles see data from same owner only)
- Soft delete for audit trail

### Code Standards
- **DRY & KISS**: Avoid duplication, keep solutions simple
- **Type Safety**: Use Zod schemas, typed models throughout
- **Security**: Never expose secrets/keys, validate all inputs
- **Testing**: Test at controller layer via HTTP endpoints
- **ID Generation**: `randomUUID()` for DB primary keys, `nanoid()` for barcodes only
- **🛡️ GUARD CLAUSES MANDATORY**: Always use guard clauses instead of nested if statements for better readability and early returns

### 🛡️ **GUARD CLAUSE PATTERNS** 🛡️

**MANDATORY**: All new code must use guard clauses instead of nested if statements for better readability and maintainability.

#### **Required Guard Clause Patterns:**

```dart
// ✅ CORRECT: Early return validation
Future<void> saveData() async {
  if (!isValid) return;
  if (!hasPermission) return;
  if (!mounted) return;
  
  // Main logic here
}

// ❌ WRONG: Nested if statements
Future<void> saveData() async {
  if (isValid) {
    if (hasPermission) {
      if (mounted) {
        // Main logic here
      }
    }
  }
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Conditional processing with guard clauses
void processItem(String? item) {
  if (item == null) return;
  if (item.isEmpty) return;
  
  // Process item logic
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Widget mounted checks
void updateUI() {
  if (!mounted) return;
  
  setState(() {
    // Update logic
  });
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Permission checks
void performAction() {
  if (!user.hasPermission) return;
  if (user.role != UserRole.admin) return;
  
  // Action logic
}
```

#### **Benefits of Guard Clauses:**
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Less nesting, easier to read
- **Early validation**: Fail fast pattern
- **Cleaner code**: Eliminate deeply nested if statements
- **Better error handling**: Clear validation boundaries
- **Improved maintainability**: Easier to modify and debug

### 📱 **RESPONSIVE UI PATTERNS** 📱

**MANDATORY**: All widgets, screens, and UI components must be responsive and handle text/content overflow gracefully.

#### **Required Responsive Patterns:**

```dart
// ✅ CORRECT: Use Flexible/Expanded for Row/Column children
Row(
  children: [
    Flexible(
      child: Text('Label', overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis),
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Long content that might overflow', 
        overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis),
    ),
  ],
)

// ✅ CORRECT: Wrap long content with overflow handling
Container(
  constraints: BoxConstraints(maxWidth: 200),
  child: Text(
    'Very long text that needs to be truncated',
    overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
    maxLines: 1,
  ),
)

// ✅ CORRECT: Use SingleChildScrollView for potentially long content
SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: [...],
  ),
)

// ❌ WRONG: Fixed width containers without overflow handling
Container(
  width: 200,
  child: Text('This might overflow'), // Will cause RenderFlex errors
)

// ❌ WRONG: Row/Column without Flexible/Expanded
Row(
  children: [
    Text('Label'),
    Text('Very long content'), // Will overflow
  ],
)
```

#### **Responsive UI Requirements:**
- **Always use `Flexible` or `Expanded`** for Row/Column children that contain text
- **Always add `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`** for text that might be long
- **Use `SingleChildScrollView`** for content that might exceed screen height
- **Test on different screen sizes** - mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Handle edge cases** - very long product names, UUIDs, currency amounts
- **Wrap content appropriately** using `Wrap` widget when needed
- **Use `LayoutBuilder`** for complex responsive layouts
- **Add `maxLines`** parameter for multi-line text control

### 📱 **MOBILE DEVICE COMPATIBILITY** 📱

**MANDATORY**: All mobile UI must be optimized for standard smartphone dimensions and ensure perfect compatibility with common device sizes.

#### **Target Device Specifications:**
- **Reference Device**: 168.6 x 76.6 x 9 mm (6.64 x 3.02 x 0.35 in)
- **Screen Width**: ~76.6mm (~375-390px logical pixels)
- **Usable Height**: ~150mm (~700-800px logical pixels after system UI)

#### **Mobile Design Requirements:**
- **Text Breaking**: NO text overflow or word breaking - use `TextOverflow.ellipsis` and `maxLines`
- **Button Positioning**: Minimum 44x44 logical pixels touch targets, properly spaced
- **Content Spacing**: Minimum 16px margins, 8-24px between sections
- **Scrollable Content**: Always use `SingleChildScrollView` for forms and long lists
- **Responsive Widgets**: All components must adapt to narrow screen widths
- **Safe Area**: Respect device safe areas with `SafeArea` widget
- **Keyboard Handling**: Form fields must handle keyboard overlay properly
- **Portrait Orientation**: Primary design for portrait mode (76.6mm width)
- **Compact Layout**: Efficient use of vertical space, collapsible sections where appropriate

#### **Mobile Testing Checklist:**
- ✅ **No horizontal overflow** on narrow screens (375px width)
- ✅ **Text readability** with proper font sizes (14sp minimum)
- ✅ **Touch targets** meet accessibility guidelines (44dp minimum)
- ✅ **Form usability** with keyboard navigation and proper scrolling
- ✅ **Content priority** - most important information visible without scrolling
- ✅ **Loading states** properly centered and sized for mobile
- ✅ **Error messages** fit within screen bounds without overflow

### 🚫 **CRITICAL DATABASE MODEL PROTECTION** 🚫
**NEVER MODIFY** these files without explicit user request:
- `src/models/users.ts`, `src/models/stores.ts`, `src/models/categories.ts`
- `src/models/products.ts`, `src/models/transactions.ts`, `src/models/product_checks.ts`, `src/models/product_imeis.ts`

### API Response Standards
- **ALWAYS use `ResponseUtils`** from `src/utils/responses.ts`
- **ALWAYS use Zod schemas** for validation
- **Required format**: `BaseResponse<T>` or `PaginatedResponse<T>`

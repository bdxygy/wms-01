# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Warehouse Management System (WMS)** - A complete inventory management system for tracking goods across multiple stores with role-based access control, featuring web and mobile applications.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Hono, Node.js, Zod, Drizzle, SQLite Turso ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**
- **Frontend Web**: React, Shadcn, Zod, React Query, Tailwindcss, Rsbuild üìã **PLANNED**
- **Mobile**: Flutter (cross-platform mobile development) ‚úÖ **PHASE 18++ COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY**

### Architecture

- **Service layer** for business logic
- **Soft delete** for audit trail
- **Owner-scoped data access** for non-owner roles
- **Hono best practice pattern** - no controller layer, routes use service layer directly

## üì± **Mobile Application Status**

**Current Status**: Production Ready (Phase 18++ Complete) | **Next**: Phase 19 - Thermal Printer Integration

*See [Mobile Development Phases](docs/mobile-development-phases.md) for complete phase details and architecture information.*

## ü§ñ **Available Agents**

The following specialized agents are available for different aspects of the WMS project:

### **Backend Development (kang_BE)**
**Use for**: Expert-level backend development guidance, architecture decisions, or technical problem-solving for server-side systems.

**Examples**:
- "I'm seeing performance issues with our Hono API endpoints under load, how should I optimize them?"
- "Should we implement caching for our product inventory endpoints, and if so, what's the best approach with our current SQLite/Drizzle setup?"
- "Review this JWT authentication middleware - is the role-based access control properly implemented for owner-scoped data?"
- "We're planning to scale beyond single-store operations, how should we refactor our service layer for multi-tenant architecture?"
- "Debug this transaction service - the soft delete audit trail isn't capturing all the required fields"

### **Frontend Web Development (kang_FE_WEB)**
**Use for**: Expert guidance on frontend web development topics including modern frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, Next.js, Remix, Astro), state management, component architecture, performance optimization, debugging strategies, or framework comparisons.

- "When facing stakeholder misalignment, facilitate alignment through proven frameworks and communication strategies"
- "When planning a major product redesign, establish the product vision, create the design system, and structure the project timeline"

### **System Analysis (kang_System_Analyst)**
**Use for**: Expert-level system analysis for technical or business systems including analyzing existing systems, designing new architectures, improving system efficiency, or validating requirements.

**Examples**:
- "After writing a new service, analyze its architecture and identify potential bottlenecks"
- "When planning a new feature, break it down into system components and workflows"
- "When stakeholders provide vague requirements, gather and validate technical specifications"

### **General Purpose (general-purpose)**

## üéØ **Agent Usage Guidelines**

### **When to Use Each Agent**

**Always use specialized agents** - never use generic prompts. Use the specific agent that matches your task:

1. **Backend code/architecture** ‚Üí `kang_BE`
2. **Flutter mobile development** ‚Üí `kang_FE_Flutter`
3. **Frontend web development** ‚Üí `kang_FE_WEB`
4. **Product strategy/design** ‚Üí `kang_PM2PD`
5. **System analysis/requirements** ‚Üí `kang_System_Analyst`
6. **Complex research/search tasks** ‚Üí `general-purpose`

### **Agent Invocation Format**
```
Use Task tool with subagent_type parameter:
- subagent_type='kang_BE' for backend
- subagent_type='kang_FE_Flutter' for Flutter
- subagent_type='kang_FE_WEB' for web frontend
- subagent_type='kang_PM2PD' for product management
- subagent_type='kang_System_Analyst' for system analysis
- subagent_type='general-purpose' for research
```

### **Example Usage**
```
Task(description="Optimize transaction service", prompt="Analyze transaction service performance...", subagent_type='kang_BE')
```

## üîê **Critical Protections**

- **üö´ NEVER MODIFY** database model files without explicit user request
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS use ResponseUtils** from `src/utils/responses.ts`
- **‚úÖ ALWAYS use Zod schemas** for validation
- **üîê ROLE-BASED AUTHORIZATION**: All endpoints enforce proper role permissions and owner scoping

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Error Handling Rules**

### **Exception/Error Throwing Guidelines**

**üö´ NEVER throw exceptions after calling callback functions** - This can cause app hangs and poor UX:

```dart
// ‚ùå WRONG - Don't do this
} catch (e) {
  onProductNotFound(barcode);
  throw Exception('Product not found'); // This causes app hang!
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Do this instead
} catch (e) {
  onProductNotFound(barcode);
  // Let callback handle UI response, don't throw
}
```

**‚úÖ ONLY throw exceptions in these scenarios:**
1. **Input validation failures** (invalid format, missing required data)
2. **System/Infrastructure errors** (network, database connection issues)
3. **Within try-catch blocks** where the exception will be properly handled
4. **When no callback exists** to handle the error scenario

**üìã Exception Best Practices:**
- **Always use meaningful error messages** that help debugging
- **Never throw after UI callbacks** (onSuccess, onError, onNotFound, etc.)
- **Let callback functions handle user-facing error messages**
- **Use proper error propagation** in service layers
- **Test error scenarios** to ensure they don't cause hangs or crashes

## üöÄ **Next Development Priorities**

### Recent Completions ‚úÖ
- **IMEI Per-Store Uniqueness Implementation**: Multi-store IMEI business logic allowing same IMEI across different stores

### Immediate Priorities
12. **Mobile Phase 19**: Thermal Printer Integration (2-3 days) *(Next Priority)*
13. **Mobile Phase 20**: Analytics, Reporting & Production Deployment (3-4 days)
14. **Web Frontend Development**: Build React UI using the complete API contract (optional)

## üìä **Agent Memory Integration**

All agents are now configured to understand:
- **Project architecture** and tech stack
- **Current development status** (Phase 18++ mobile complete)
- **Role-based access control** system
- **Transaction type handling** (TRANSFER, TRADE, SALE)
- **QR code integration** in receipts
- **IMEI per-store uniqueness** business logic (same IMEI allowed across different stores, unique within same store)
- **Integration testing infrastructure** with comprehensive product creation test coverage
- **Production-ready status** of mobile application

This memory ensures all agents provide contextually relevant guidance aligned with the WMS project goals and current state.

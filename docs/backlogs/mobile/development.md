# Mobile Development Backlog - 20 Phases

Complete Flutter mobile application development from zero with focus on business workflows, thermal printing, and barcode/IMEI scanning integration.

---

## 📋 **Project Overview**

**Status**: Starting from scratch (mobile project deleted)  
**Target**: Complete WMS Flutter mobile application  
**Platform**: Flutter (iOS & Android)  
**Backend Integration**: 40+ production-ready API endpoints  
**Timeline**: 20 phases over 8-10 weeks  
**Architecture**: Clean Architecture folder structures with feature-based structure

---

## 🎯 **User Flow Requirements**

### **Authentication Flow Based on Role**
- **NON-OWNER Users**: Login → "Welcoming Choose Store" screen → Select store → Role-based dashboard (no store panel)
- **OWNER Users**: Login → Full dashboard with store management capabilities

### **Key Business Workflows**
1. **Product Creation** → Auto-navigate to detail → Print barcode
2. **Transaction Creation** → Auto-print receipt → Transaction detail with "Print Payment Note"
3. **Barcode Scanning** → Add items to transactions OR find products
4. **IMEI Scanning** → Find products by IMEI number

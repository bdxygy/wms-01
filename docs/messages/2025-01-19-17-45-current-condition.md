- ✅ **Advanced features**: IMEI tracking, barcode generation, photo proof
- ✅ **Production infrastructure**: validation, error handling, pagination, filtering
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** with integration test coverage

### **📱 Mobile Status: PHASE 1 READY (0% Complete)**
- 📋 **Mobile project deleted** - starting fresh from zero
- 📋 **20-phase development plan** completed and documented
- 📋 **Flutter architecture** defined with clean architecture structure
- 📋 **User flows planned**: NON-OWNER store selection → OWNER bypass flows
- 📋 **Business workflows**: Product creation → barcode printing, Transaction → receipt printing
- 📋 **Integration points**: Barcode/IMEI scanning, thermal printing, camera capture
- 📋 **API contract documentation** ready for mobile integration

### **📄 Frontend Web Status: PLANNED (0% Complete)**
- 📋 **API contract** ready for React integration
- 📋 **Tech stack planned**: React, Shadcn, Zod, React Query, Tailwindcss, Rsbuild
- 📋 **Not prioritized** - mobile development takes precedence

## 🎯 **Current Session Tasks**

### **Task Requested**
Split `@docs/frontend-api-contract.md` into separate React and Flutter API contracts, then update mobile development plan to reference the Flutter-specific contract.

### **Task Status**
- 📋 **In Progress**: Read existing API contract documentation
- 📋 **In Progress**: Read mobile development plan
- 📋 **Pending**: Create React-specific API contract
- 📋 **Pending**: Create Flutter-specific API contract
- 📋 **Pending**: Update mobile development plan reference

### **Files to be Created/Modified**
1. **NEW**: `/docs/react-api-contract.md` - Web-specific API integration guide
2. **NEW**: `/docs/flutter-api-contract.md` - Mobile-specific API integration guide  
3. **UPDATE**: `/docs/backlogs/mobile/development.md` - Reference Flutter API contract
4. **CLEANUP**: Consider archiving or removing original `/docs/frontend-api-contract.md`

## 🏗️ **Mobile Development Readiness**

### **Phase 1: Project Foundation & Setup** (Ready to Start)
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Priority**: CRITICAL
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: Waiting for user approval to begin

### **Key User Flows to Implement**
1. **NON-OWNER Users**: Login → "Welcoming Choose Store" screen → Select store → Role-based dashboard
2. **OWNER Users**: Login → Full dashboard with store management capabilities

### **Business Workflows to Implement**
1. **Product Creation** → Auto-navigate to detail → Print barcode
2. **Transaction Creation** → Auto-print receipt → Transaction detail with "Print Payment Note"
3. **Barcode Scanning** → Add items to transactions OR find products
4. **IMEI Scanning** → Find products by IMEI number

## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend (Completed)**
- **Framework**: Hono.js with Node.js
- **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **API**: RESTful with 40+ endpoints
- **Testing**: Comprehensive integration tests

### **Mobile (Planned)**
- **Framework**: Flutter (iOS & Android)
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with feature-based structure
- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **Navigation**: GoRouter with route guards
- **API Client**: Dio with interceptors
- **Security**: Flutter Secure Storage for tokens
- **Scanning**: Mobile Scanner for barcodes/IMEI
- **Printing**: Bluetooth thermal printers
- **Camera**: Image capture for proof photos
